# Leaf support in Atom
[![OS X Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ButkiewiczP/atom-language-leaf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ButkiewiczP/atom-language-leaf)

Adds syntax highlighting to [Leaf](https://github.com/vapor/leaf) files in Atom. Leaf is a templating language, written in Swift, and used in the [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) Framework

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request. This grammar set is only a primitive implementation and will likely change as leaf evolves.
